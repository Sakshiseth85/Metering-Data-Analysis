5. Averge meters per order: The average no. of meters sold per order, calculated by dividing the total no. of meters sold by the total no. of orders.


Charts Requirement: 


6. Percentage of sales by meter category: Pie chart that shows distribution of sales across differenct meter categories. This will give the popularity of categories and their contribution to overall sales.

7. Total meter sold by meter category: FUnnel chart that shows no. of meters sold for each category. Will show the performance of each meter category

8. Top sellers ny revenue, total quantity, total orders: Create bar chart showing 5 best selling meters based on revenue, total quantity, total orders. 

9. Bottom best sellers by revenue, total quantity, total orders.
Bar chart showing the ottom 5 worst selling meters based on revenue, total quantity, total orders.
